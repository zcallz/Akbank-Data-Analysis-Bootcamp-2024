# Akbank-Data-Analysis-Bootcamp-2024

Project Summary:

This project aims to analyze students' exam performance. The dataset includes various demographic and academic features such as students' gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course completion status, and scores in math, reading, and writing exams.

Project Objective:

The primary objective of the project is to determine the factors influencing students' exam performance and understand the relationships among these factors. Additionally, the project aims to identify potential strategies to improve student success. This analysis can provide valuable insights for the development of educational policies and interventions aimed at enhancing student achievement.

Used Datasets:

The dataset is obtained from a CSV file named "StudentsPerformance.csv," which contains information about students' exam performances. It includes various variables such as demographic characteristics and exam results.

Key Findings:

- There is a strong correlation among math, reading, and writing exam scores.
- Students with parents who have higher levels of education tend to have higher exam scores.
- Demographic factors such as gender and race/ethnicity are also examined for their influence on exam performance.

  Data Analysis

Correlation Analysis: One of the fundamental techniques in data analysis is correlation analysis. It allows us to understand the relationship between different variables in our dataset. This insight aids in identifying patterns, dependencies, and potential causal relationships within the data.

Data Visualization in Python: Visualizing data is essential for gaining a deeper understanding and communicating insights effectively. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, offers versatile tools for creating insightful visualizations. From simple scatter plots to complex interactive visualizations, Python empowers analysts to represent data in a visually appealing and comprehensible manner, facilitating better decision-making processes.

Heatmaps: Heatmaps are powerful visualization tools for displaying the magnitude of relationships between variables in a dataset. They provide a visual representation of correlation matrices, making it easier to identify clusters of correlated variables or patterns of interest. By incorporating color gradients to denote the strength of correlations, heatmaps offer an intuitive way to interpret complex relationships within the data.

Central Statistics Tendency and Dispersion by Group: Understanding the central tendency and dispersion of data by different groups is essential for gaining insights into variations and distributions within the dataset. Measures such as mean, median, and mode provide insights into the typical or central values of a group, while measures of dispersion such as variance and standard deviation quantify the spread of data points around the central tendency. Analyzing these statistics across various groups enables us to discern patterns, outliers, and trends specific to each subgroup.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Data quality is paramount in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of analysis outcomes. Data cleaning and preprocessing involve identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and missing values within the dataset. Techniques such as imputation, outlier detection, and normalization play a crucial role in preparing the data for analysis, ensuring that subsequent analyses are based on clean and reliable data.

Feature Engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models. This process often requires domain knowledge and creativity to extract relevant information from raw data. Techniques such as binning, encoding categorical variables, and creating interaction terms can significantly improve the performance of predictive models by capturing underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to the predictive power of a model. Feature selection techniques help identify the most relevant features that contribute the most to the predictive performance while eliminating redundant or irrelevant ones. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, feature selection not only improves the model's interpretability but also enhances its efficiency and generalization capabilities.
